# Sveltekit [svelte-cubed](https://svelte-cubed.vercel.app/) Three Graces Design Study

This is a recreation of the Three Graces Projects by [drcmda](https://github.com/drcmda/testlighting) and [Anderson Mancini](https://github.com/ektogamat/threejs-graces). My goal was to recreate the original Three Graces by drcmda in Svelte as close as possible. I hope you enjoy!

Here is a screenshot of the app:

```bash

```
